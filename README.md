Day-1

Data Cleaning And Preprocessing Imorted raw data into ms excel named as "amazon data" from kaggle platform To begin with,I identified missing values by filtering whole data set in excel. Selected whole data and clicked remove duplicate files from data tab. Then, Standardized text values of columns - city,state and paymentmode. Renamed column headers in lower case format. rechecked data tyoes of amount and profit columns as well as order date column wether their format is correct or not.

learnt to use excel features and functions for real world datasets. Improved my understanding of data preprocessing ,which is a critical ask before data analysis. Built confidence in handling raw data sets independently. Created a clean, structured dataset that is ready for analysis and modelingb as well.
